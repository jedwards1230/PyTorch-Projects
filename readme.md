A collection of projects for learning about PyTorch and machine learning

EMNIST has a jupyter notebook used to tinker with convolutional networks from pytorch and the balanced EMNIST dataset (letters and numbers) to classify handwritten characters

object-detection uses various methods from pytorch and opencv to classify objects and track them from a video stream
