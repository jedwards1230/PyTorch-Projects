Basic training, testing, and experimentation of EMNIST dataset with PyTorch

I used various tutorials for the MNIST dataset to put this together and get a good feel of how things play together. I now have something decent that works, so I need to optimize further to really learn the ins and outs.

* Train Accuracy: 84.02%
* Train Loss: 0.4751

* Test Accuracy: 88.24%
* Test Loss: 0.3395

TODO:
* Add data augmentation
* Increase accuracy to 90%?
* More visualizations in notebook
