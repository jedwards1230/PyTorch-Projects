Basic training, testing, and experimentation of EMNIST dataset with PyTorch

I used various tutorials for the MNIST dataset to put this together and get a good feel of how things play together. I now have something decent that works, so I need to optimize further to really learn the ins and outs.

* Accuracy: 88%
* Test Loss: 0.3618

TODO:
* Increase accuracy to at least 90%
* Display images vs predictions in TensorBoard
* More visualizations in notebook
